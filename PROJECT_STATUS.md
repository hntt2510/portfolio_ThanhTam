## Approved design constraints

- Glass & Light Museum; Circular Atrium and circular skylight.
- Three staggered frosted-glass panels, subtle highlights and restrained reflections.
- Bright warm-white / silver / pale blue palette; no dark navy or neon.
- Hero content left; fixed scroll-aware vertical navigation right.
- Camera beats K01 Establishing, K02 Approach, K03 Focus, K04 Transition.
- One persistent 3D world, reversible normalized scroll, HTML overlays for readable content.
- Incremental development: design/approve/handoff/build/verify each milestone before the next.

## Milestone 01B Delivery Summary (2026-11-03)

- **Source Asset:** Loaded `design-handoff/milestone-01A/entrance-atrium.glb` into `src/scenes/entrance-atrium.js`, completely replacing procedural geometry.
- **Vendor Tooling:** Packaged offline `GLTFLoader.js` and `BufferGeometryUtils.js` in `assets/vendor/` and linked via import map in `index.html`.
- **Coordinate Reconciliation:** Mapped Blender $Z$-up to Three.js $Y$-up ($X = X, Y = Z, Z = -Y$).
- **Camera Motion:** Catmull-Rom spline trajectory with dynamic FOV interpolation across K01 (22mm / 57°), K02 (35mm / 46°), K03 (~45mm / 42°), K04 (32mm / 48°).
- **Material Tuning:** Luminous frosted glass (`MeshPhysicalMaterial`) catching subtle daylight highlights, transparent skylight dome, brushed aluminum trims, and stone plinth with LED halo.
- **Decals & Typography:** Applied high-resolution, unskewed canvas decals ("01 Business Analysis", "02 Enterprise Systems", "03 Technology Solutions").
- **Verification Evidence:**
  - Automated tests via Playwright in `design-handoff/milestone-01B/test_and_capture.py`.
  - Desktop 1440x900 screenshots (K01, K02, K03, K04, Reverse Scroll).
  - Mobile 390x844 responsive screenshots (K01, K03).
  - 2D Canvas fallback screenshot.
  - Console hygiene: 0 errors, 0 warnings.
  - Detailed report: `design-handoff/milestone-01B/verification-report.md`.

## Milestone 02A Delivery Summary (2026-11-04)

- **Blender Generator Script:** Created `design-handoff/milestone-02/generate_profile_gallery.py` building a curved gallery architecture with 39 modular meshes adhering to the `PRG_` prefix.
- **Physical Seam Continuity:** Connects cleanly to Scene 01's north-east corridor portal at $(15.0, 15.0, 0.0)$ with zero floor or wall discontinuity.
- **Curved Layout:** Radius $R = 25.0\text{m}$, gallery width $W = 5.20\text{m}$, sweeping from $\alpha = 135^\circ$ to $\alpha = 65^\circ$.
- **Asset Verification:** Exported `design-handoff/milestone-02/profile-gallery.glb` (126.66 KB, 3,280 vertices, 1,646 polygons, 7 safe glTF PBR materials, 0 lights, 0 cameras).
- **Proof Renders:** Headless Blender 5.2.3 LTS renders for K05, K06, K07, K08, top-down overview, and corridor seam check.
- **Spec Adherence:** 100% background architecture. Zero 3D text/panels inside GLB. Detailed technical report in `design-handoff/milestone-02/asset-report-02A.md`.

## Scene 02 approval — 2026-11-04

- **Design approval:** Profile Gallery **V2** approved for owner **Hoàng Nguyễn Thành Tâm**.
- **Design shift:** one light-filled curved corridor; four About messages in screen-fixed HTML overlay, strictly **no information panels or text in 3D objects**.
- **Continuity:** K05 starts from existing Scene 01 K04; integrate global-scroll-to-chapter-local progress with reversible camera and UI behavior.
- **Design source:** `design-handoff/milestone-02/SCENE02-V2-APPROVED.md`; visual reference PNGs, comprehensive spec, prompts and QA checklist accompany the handoff ZIP.
- **Next execution:** 02A Blender architecture and GLB export (Committed & Verified) → 02B Three.js/DOM integration → browser tests, commit, auto push. Follow `AGENTS.md`.

## GitHub publishing rules

After each successfully verified completed unit of work, the implementation agent must commit and push to GitHub automatically without a separate approval prompt, subject to safe Git practices and repository protection. Never assert remote success without confirming the remote SHA. See `AGENTS.md`.
